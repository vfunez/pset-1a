		<h1>Vanya Funez's Student Life</h1>
		<p>As stated in the Autobiography page, I am a sophomore at the Academy for Information Technology. Interestingly enough, this has been my dream school since the second grade. So me getting into this high school, was a big deal. As of now, I can honestly say that this is school is so much better then what I expected. The teachers and students are some of the best people I have ever meet, and I can’t wait to see what the next few years have to hold.</p>
